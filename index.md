Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I'm Andrew Leem, a master's student at Northwestern University pursuing a degree in Machine Learning and Data Science. With a background in Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences (BS, 2018), I've developed a passion for leveraging data and machine learning to solve real-world problems. My projects focus on applying techniques like predictive modeling, data analysis, and machine learning to uncover insights and drive business decisions. Here, you'll find a collection of my work showcasing my technical skills in Python, SQL, and R, and my experience with tools like TensorFlow and scikit-learn.

In addition to my technical expertise, I’ve interned as a Data Analyst at Gerson Lehrman Group and worked independently on the Korea Data Project, where I automated data collection and analysis using Selenium and Python. I’m excited to apply my skills in practical, impactful ways, and I look forward to collaborating on exciting data-driven projects.

Outside of data science, I enjoy playing basketball, lifting weights, and spending time with family. Feel free to explore my work, and don’t hesitate to connect! You can also discover my work @ [GitHub](https://github.com/hyunstar11)
