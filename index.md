Welcome to my portfolio page! I'm Andrew Leem, also known as Kyu Hyun, currently applying to master's programs in data science and updating this page with my latest projects and skills. Discover more of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/hyunstar11)

I graduated with a BS in Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences from Northwestern University in 2018. Outside of data science, I enjoy basketball, lifting, and spending quality time with my family. My technical specialties include Python, SQL, and R, and I'm eager to apply these in practical, impactful ways.
